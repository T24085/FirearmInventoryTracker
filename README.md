# Firearm Inventory Tracker

This desktop application helps manage a personal firearm collection. Data is stored in a local JSON file so nothing leaves your computer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- `matplotlib` and `fpdf2` Python packages

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install matplotlib fpdf2
```

## Usage
Run the program with:
```
python app.py
```

Use the form to add firearms and the table to edit or delete them. The "Export CSV" and "Export PDF" buttons save reports in those formats.
